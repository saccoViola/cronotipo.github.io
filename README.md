This project was a collaboration between me and a friend who is a graphic designer. She created the visual design, while I focused on writing the code.

The idea came from a conversation about sleep habits â€” we challenged ourselves to create a quiz that helps users discover their "sleep animal," inspired by the four chronotypes.

It was a fun and quick project to build, and a great opportunity to experiment with teamwork and creativity!
